## 📖 About The Project
This project is a lightweight, dynamic web application that simulates an online bakery. It demonstrates core front-end development skills, including DOM manipulation, state management (shopping cart logic), and modern CSS layout techniques, all without the use of external frameworks or libraries.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Shopping Cart:** Users can add items, view cart counts, and remove items. The total price calculates and updates dynamically in real-time.
* **Interactive UI/UX:** Features custom CSS animations, hover effects, and a floating JavaScript notification system that alerts users when an item is added to the cart.
* **Responsive Grid Layout:** Utilizes CSS Grid (`auto-fit`, `minmax`) to ensure the product display seamlessly adapts to any screen size, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
* **Thematic Styling:** Employs a cohesive, custom color palette (AliceBlue, PowderBlue, SteelBlue) to create a clean and inviting user interface.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Custom Styling)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** (Cart logic, DOM manipulation, Event handling)

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The main structure of the storefront and cart interface.
* `styles.css` - Custom stylesheet handling responsive layouts and animations.
* `script.js` - The JavaScript engine managing the `cart` array, total calculations, and visual DOM updates.
* `*.jpg` - High-quality image assets for the product cards.
